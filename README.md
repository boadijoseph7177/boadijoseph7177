# Hi, I’m Joseph 👋🏾

I’m a Computer Science student and backend-focused engineer interested in **distributed systems, data-intensive applications, and ML-backed infrastructure**.

My work sits at the intersection of **real-world system building and research-oriented thinking**—understanding performance tradeoffs, correctness, and reliability in production-like environments.

---

## 🔬 Current Focus
- Designing backend systems that model **real operational constraints** (latency, consistency, offline operation, compliance).
- Exploring how **data systems and distributed services** can be made more robust, observable, and scalable.
- Preparing for both **industry backend roles** and **research-focused graduate study** in systems and ML systems.

---

## 🔧 What I’m working on
- **E-VAT–Compliant Sales & Inventory System (Ghana)**  
  A backend-first system exploring transaction integrity, auditability, and offline-first synchronization under regulatory constraints.
- **Systems & Backend Experiments**  
  Prototypes focused on API design, concurrency, and data modeling decisions.
- **Foundational Prep**  
  Distributed systems, algorithms, and performance-oriented backend design.

## 🛠 Technical Interests
- Distributed & data-intensive systems
- Backend architecture & correctness
- Concurrency and performance
- ML systems & applied data engineering
- Systems design under real-world constraints
